# WoW Classic: CoinDrops Dataset & Addon

A dataset with the average copper drop (raw and net vendor value) of every mob in World of Warcraft Vanilla as scraped from wowhead's resources. Additionally, a lite in game addon 'VendorThisMob' which displays the average copper drop of the current target and how it compares to other mobs of the same level.
